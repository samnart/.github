# Skill Link

Hi everyone,  
Weâ€™re building SkillLink, the Peer Mentorship Network. 

## Vision
Our vision is to make personalized mentorship accessible to everyone: students, career changers and lifelong learners, helping them find direction and grow with purpose.

## Problem
The problem is that many people struggle to find mentors who understand their goals or provide actionable feedback. That leaves them stuck and uncertain about their next steps.

## Solution
Our solution begins with an AI mentor that helps users explore their interests, skills, and career paths. As SkillLink grows, it will connect users with peers of slightly higher skill levels, creating a living mentorship ecosystem powered by real people helping one another.
